CREATE REACT APP:

Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.
You'll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:

# npx create-react-app my-app
# cd my-app
# npm start

Then install axios by, run:

# npm i axios

After creating the app and installing axios replace the original "src folder" with our "src folder".
